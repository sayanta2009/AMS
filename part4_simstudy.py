    Exercise to plot the scatter plot of (a) IAT and serving time, (b) serving time and system time
    The scatter plot helps to better understand the meaning of bit/small covariance/correlation.
    For every rho, two scatter plots are needed.

    For the different rho values, simulation is run and the waiting time is auto correlated.
    Results are plotted for each N value in a different diagram.
    Note, that for some seeds with rho=0.01 and N=100, the variance of the auto covariance is 0 and returns an error.
